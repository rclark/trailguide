## Trailhead
A trailhead is a place where you get out of your car and start hiking.

## Segment
A segment is a section of hikable trail that exists between two forks.

## Route
A route is a collection of segments that form a complete path someone may wish to hike.
A route must start at one trailhead and end at another, or at the same one it started from.

## PointOfInterest
A point of interest is some place in the world that we think people would like to look at or visit.

## Region
A region is an area on the surface of the earth that has some name, and maybe some rules about what you can and can't do within it.

## Profile
A profile is additional information about our site's users. We're not totally sure what we'll need here yet.

## Comment
A comment is some text-based information that a user can associate with anything -- a trailhead, a segment, a route, another user, etc.

## Description
A description exists because I envision that we might need this later.

## Upload
An upload is something that a user uploads to the site. Maybe a picture, maybe a .GPX file indicating where they walked, maybe something else.
