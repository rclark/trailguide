### /static/templates
Put Jade template files here to be used client-side. Compile them using the utility in [/utils/jade2js](https://github.com/rclark/trailguide/tree/master/utils/jade2js) which will convert the files to JavaScript functions in [/static/scripts/templates](https://github.com/rclark/trailguide/tree/master/static/templates)
